# My Website

This repository contains a simple website.

## Pages

- `index.html`: main homepage showing carousels and game listings.

## Building the Site

1. Edit the HTML files directly. They are static and open in a browser.
2. You can write Markdown content here and convert it to HTML using a tool such as [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) or an online converter.

## Example Markdown

```markdown
# Welcome to My Site

This is a sample page. You can add paragraphs, links, and lists.

- Item 1
- Item 2

[Go back to home](./index.html)
```

## Converting Markdown to HTML

If you want to include Markdown on your site, convert it and copy the HTML into your `.html` files, or use a static site generator.

```bash
pandoc site.md -o site.html
```

`site.html` will contain the HTML version of the Markdown above.
